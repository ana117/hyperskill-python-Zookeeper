## Stages
**Stage 1/4: Rush into print**\
First, let's try to get some simple output from your code.\
Objective: The program should display a text from the example.

**Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!**\
Show the zookeeper an image of her ward.\
Objective: The program should display an ASCII image of a camel.

**Stage 3/4: What's inside?**\
The zookeeper wants to know what is inside each habitat, by its number.\
Objective: The program should ask a number and print the correct habitat.

**Stage 4/4: Sustainable care <3**\
Finally, your program is able to work for as long as needed!\
Objective: The program should repeat the behavior from stage 3, but in a loop until the user input an exit word.
